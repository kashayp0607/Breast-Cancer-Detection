## Breast Cancer Classification with Neural Network

Breast cancer is a critical health concern affecting millions of people worldwide. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment and improved outcomes. This project focuses on utilizing a Neural Network for the classification of breast cancer based on features extracted from fine needle aspirate (FNA) images of breast masses.

### Dataset Overview
The dataset used in this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It comprises features computed from digitized FNA images, including attributes like mean radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, and more. The dataset contains 569 instances, with two classes: malignant and benign.

### Project Workflow
1. **Data Loading and Exploration:** The project begins with loading the dataset using the scikit-learn library. The dataset is then converted into a Pandas DataFrame for exploration.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** The dataset is checked for missing values, and statistical measures are calculated. The target variable is encoded, and the data is split into training and testing sets.

3. **Standardization:** To ensure uniformity in feature scales, the data is standardized using the StandardScaler from scikit-learn.

4. **Neural Network Model:** A Neural Network model is constructed using TensorFlow and Keras. The model consists of input layers, hidden layers with activation functions, and an output layer with the sigmoid activation function.

5. **Model Training:** The Neural Network is trained using the training data, and the training process is monitored for accuracy and loss. The model is validated using a subset of the training data.

6. **Visualization:** The accuracy and loss curves during training are visualized to assess the model's performance.

7. **Model Evaluation:** The trained model is evaluated on the test dataset, and accuracy metrics are computed.

8. **Prediction:** Finally, the model is used to predict the class labels for a sample input, demonstrating its practical application.

By employing advanced machine learning techniques like Neural Networks, this project aims to contribute to the accurate and early diagnosis of breast cancer, ultimately improving patient outcomes.
